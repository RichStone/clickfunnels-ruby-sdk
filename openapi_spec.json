To reassign the Opportunity to a different team member, simply update this value. To remove the assignee, set the `assignee_id` to `null`. The `assignee_id` corresponds to the `membership.id` in the relevant Team, which can be retrieved using the Teams API.\n\nWhen an Opportunity is moved to a stage with a `close_probability` value of 0 or 100, the `closed_at` timestamp is automatically set. If the Opportunity is later moved to a different stage, the `closed_at` timestamp remains unchanged. You can also manually set the `closed_at` timestamp using the API.\n"},{"name":"Sales::Opportunities::Note","description":"Sales Opportunity
